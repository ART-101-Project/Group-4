          Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers and
          machines to engage in human intelligence in order to accomplish
          problem solving. Emerging as a field of computer science, AI seeks to
          process data information while recognizing patterns and making
          predictions/decisions modeled after human judgment. Linked to machine
          and deep learning, artificial intelligence “learns” from existing
          information that is programmed within the system. This allows the
          machine to facilitate cognitive functions that are usually associated
          with human minds and subsequent thinking.

                  <h2>Early 20th Century: The Start of AI</h2>
                  <p>AI first began being discussed in the early 20th century with science fiction that popularized the idea of artificially intelligent robots. Media portrayed this possibility through movies and shows, which helped spark the work within the scientific community who pondered the question “Can we train machines to use available information and reason to solve problems and make decisions?” 
          </p>
          <div class="dropdown-content">
            <p>This was brought forth by Alan Turing who explored the possibilities of AI in his 1950’s paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence. While having ideas that could have made AI much more of a reality, Turing encountered obstacles. 
              Before 1949, computers lacked the ability to store commands. This translates to computers knowing what to do when told, but being unable to remember this information. 
              Computing was extremely expensive and access was limited which prevented such advancements to be made at the time</p>

                  <p>Fast forward to the mid 50s and the first AI program titled Logic Theorist was presented by Allen Newell, Cliff Shaw, and Herbert Simon's. It attempted to emulate the problem solving abilities of people. This showcased that AI was possible and could be achieved while helping propel the next 20 years of research.

These decades showcased that in order to reach artificial intelligence, we had to focus on refining natural language processing, abstract thinking, and self recognition.

 <h2>Narrow AI or Also Known As ANI</h2>
    
<p>Narrow AI is any kind of artificial intelligence system and/or form of AI technology that's sole purpose is to complete a set of
very specific actions or basic commands. While ANI's are created with the intended goal in mind of serving and exceling in a cognitive 
capability, this particular sub-category of AI technologies still aren't able to independently learn new skills that it's not
already programmed and/or wasn't intially designed to learn. These kind of technologies are developed by combining a subfield of 
artifical intelligence called "machine learning" with neural network algorithms to fucntion properly and accomplish the specificed 
tasks it's programmed to complete. Through machine learning, AI systems are provided with the ability to process data and statistics, 
while simultaneously applying problem-solving strategies that are similar to that of strategies used by actual people, like that of 
trail and error, to improve it's own processes and "think" at faster rates. Examples of such A.I. include image recognition software,
self-driving cars, and AI virtual assistants.</p>

<br>

<h2>Artifical Genral Intelligence (AGI)</h2>
<h2>Artifical General Intelligence (AGI)</h2>

<p>Artificial General Intelligence and/or general AI is any form of artificial intelligence that's capacity for thinking, learning, and 
preforming more closely resembles that of a real person, as it's able to preform more divesive and detailed directions/tasks. While 
AGI's are still a working progress, the fundamental framework for this type of AI may be constructed from technologies such as 
supercomputers, quantum hardware and generative AI models like that of ChatGPT.</p>


<h2>Artificial Superintelligence</h2>

<p>Artificial Superintelligence and/or super AI is more of a figment of the imgaination and is showcased through numerous science fiction movies 
like that of The Termninator and Machina. It's the infamously known theroy that artificial intelligence will become significantly more 
knowledgable and efficient than humans, eventually becoming the backbone of another sub-genre of AI called self-aware AI and other 
individualistic, robotic projects. As CEO of the AI writing company, Jasper, Dave Rogenmoser once said himself,"Artificial superintelligence
will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on earth.... It will have the intelligence of human beings and will be exceedingly
better at everything that we do."</p>

<h2>Reactive Machine AI</h2>

<p>While reactive machine AI's are the most fundemntal type of AI and can respond to immediate requests/tasks, the technology is greatly limited 
in terms of storing memory, learning from past experiences and absed on that learning ehancing one's own efficiency and responding to combinations 
of inputs. Additionally, reactive machine AI's also come in handy when mainly preforming autonomous functions, such as filtering spam from email 
box's and recommending items to online shoppers based off of their personal shopping history. An example of such would be the reactive AI machine
Deep Blue, whihc in 1997 beat grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a game of chess.</p>

<h2>Limited Memory AI</h2>

<p>The expertises of limited memory AI can be found in it's ability to store previously retrieved data and then anazlye it to make predictions
Limited memory AI heavily depends on a sub-set of machine learning that's called "deep learning" which operates simiarily to that of neurons
inside the human brain. Through, such the machine is able to provess data from experiences and "learn" from them, iincreasing it's own 
accuracy and overall, functionality. The impact of this kind of AI can be seen from the sheer fact that a majority of today's AI applications
are derived from the limited memeory model and range from chatbots and virtual assistants to self-driving cars that constantly observe and 
process environmental data around them while driving on roads.</p>
