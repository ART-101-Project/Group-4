          Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers and
          machines to engage in human intelligence in order to accomplish
          problem solving. Emerging as a field of computer science, AI seeks to
          process data information while recognizing patterns and making
          predictions/decisions modeled after human judgment. Linked to machine
          and deep learning, artificial intelligence “learns” from existing
          information that is programmed within the system. This allows the
          machine to facilitate cognitive functions that are usually associated
          with human minds and subsequent thinking.

<div class="How AI Technology Came to Life (The Creation Process)-section">

<button class="reveal-btn" onclick="toggleText('text1')">Phase 1: Creating New HTML</button>
  <p id="text1" class="hidden">For our project, AI Technology, the very first task on our team's to-do list was to create a 
  brand new HTML file from scratch that included the main elements of our webpage and crucial details for it's overall 
  structure. The basic idea of our project was to create an immersive and highly interactive tool that educates users on 
  the history of artificial intelligence, how it's been incorporated into particular job fields and that highlights the 
  inaccuracy of  AI, from time to time. As for the overall design, of our webpage, our team decided that we wanted to 
  include the two main images of people and a single robot, a historical timeline of important events that's occurred in 
  reference to AI technology and a bottom section that describes more in-depthly the creation process. As for the 
  illustrations of people that the main face of our webpage will include, when users hover them a paragraph of 
  text should appear that states fact-checked and peer-reviewed information regarding how AI technology has impacted 
  the labor force,both positively and negatively and how/why it may not always be trustworthy. Additionally, when users 
  hover over our robot, it should angrily shake and generate random falsified information instead. To do such, we added
  numerous different sections to our HTML, like a "People" section that provides each individual person with their own
  button id's and "enlarge" functions, a dividing section that explains what AI is in general, and a bottom section for 
  additional links/info.</p>

  <button class="reveal-btn" onclick="toggleText('text2')">Phase 2: Drawing the Illstruations</button>
  <p id="text2" class="hidden">The main images that we utilized for AI Technology, of the people and the robot were hand-drawn using Abode Illustrator 
  and then converted into vector images. After they were converted, Sav linked them directly into our HTML and aligned 
  each image, fitting them into a flex container/flexbox.</p>

  <button class="reveal-btn" onclick="toggleText('text3')">Phase 3: Event Listeners and Hover Functions</button>
  <p id="text3" class="hidden">For the third phase, we shifted our attention over to the Javascript portion, of our project and created four
  different Javascript files.</p>
