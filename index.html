          Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers and
          machines to engage in human intelligence in order to accomplish
          problem solving. Emerging as a field of computer science, AI seeks to
          process data information while recognizing patterns and making
          predictions/decisions modeled after human judgment. Linked to machine
          and deep learning, artificial intelligence “learns” from existing
          information that is programmed within the system. This allows the
          machine to facilitate cognitive functions that are usually associated
          with human minds and subsequent thinking.

 <p>Narrow AI or Also Known As ANI
    
Narrow AI is any kind of artificial intelligence system and/or form of AI technology that's sole purpose is to complete a set of
very specific actions or basic commands. While ANI's are created with the intended goal in mind of serving and exceling in a cognitive 
capability, this particular sub-category of AI technologies still aren't able to independently learn new skills that it's not
already programmed and/or wasn't intially designed to learn. These kind of technologies are developed by combining a subfield of 
artifical intelligence called "machine learning" with neural network algorithms to fucntion properly and accomplish the specificed 
tasks it's programmed to complete. Through machine learning, AI systems are provided with the ability to process data and statistics, 
while simultaneously applying problem-solving strategies that are similar to that of strategies used by actual people, like that of 
trail and error, to improve it's own processes and "think" at faster rates. Examples of such A.I. include image recognition software,
self-driving cars, and AI virtual assistants.</p>



<p>Artifical Genral Intelligence (AGI)

Artificial General Intelligence and/or general AI is any form of artificial intelligence that's capacity for thinking, learning, and 
preforming more closely resembles that of a real person, as it's able to preform more divesive and detailed directions/tasks. While 
AGI's are still a working progress, the fundamental framework for this type of AI may be constructed from technologies such as 
supercomputers, quantum hardware and generative AI models like that of ChatGPT.</p>


<p>Artificial Superintelligence

Artificial Superintelligence and/or super AI is more of a figment of the imgaination and is showcased through numerous science fiction movies 
like that of The Termninator and Machina. It's the infamously known theroy that artificial intelligence will become significantly more 
knowledgable and efficient than humans, eventually becoming the backbone of another sub-genre of AI called self-aware AI and other 
individualistic, robotic projects. As CEO of the AI writing company, Jasper, Dave Rogenmoser once said himself,"Artificial superintelligence
will become by far the most capable forms of intelligence on earth.... It will have the intelligence of human beings and will be exceedingly
better at everything that we do."</p>

<p>Reactive Machine AI

While reactive machines are the most fundamental type of artificial intelligence, they are also greatly limited in their ability to 
store memory, learn from past experiences and thus, modify their own functionality through experiences. They're msotly useful for 
preforming basic autonomous functions, such as filtering spam from email inbox's and/or recommending items based on personal 
shopping history. An example of sucb would be that of the reactive machine, Deep Blue, whihc in 1997 was able to read realtime 
cues during a chess match against grandmaster, Garry Kasparov and actually beat him. 
</p>

<p>Limited Memory AI

Limited Memory AI is any kind of artificial intelligence tool that can make predictions from previously retrieved and stored data. 
It's able to preform tasks based on the knowledge that it acquries from the data it's saved up and applies a subset of machine
learning called "Deep Learning" that resembles the function of nenrons in the human brain. From such, different variations of AI 
like Limited Memory AI are able to gather information from experiences and "learn" ways to enahnce the accruacy of themselves 
gradually. The limited memory model represents a majority of AI applicants and can be employed in a variety settings that range 
from chatbots to self-driving cars. In fact, examples of this include chatbots and self-driving cars.
