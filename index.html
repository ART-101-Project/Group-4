          Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers and
          machines to engage in human intelligence in order to accomplish
          problem solving. Emerging as a field of computer science, AI seeks to
          process data information while recognizing patterns and making
          predictions/decisions modeled after human judgment. Linked to machine
          and deep learning, artificial intelligence “learns” from existing
          information that is programmed within the system. This allows the
          machine to facilitate cognitive functions that are usually associated
          with human minds and subsequent thinking.

<h1>How AI Technology Came to Life (The Creation Process)</h1>

<button class="reveal-btn" onclick="toggleText('text1')">Phase 1: Creating New HTML</button>
  <p id="text1" class="hidden">For our project, AI Technology, the very first task on our team's to-do list was to create a brand new HTML file from 
  scratch that included the main elements of our webpage and crucial details for it's overall structure. The basic
  idea of our project was to create an immersive and highly interactive tool that educates users on the history of
  artificial inetlligence, how it's been incorporated into particular job fields and that highlights the inaccuracy of 
  AI, from time to time. As for the overall design, of our webpage, our team decided that we wanted to include the two
  main images of people and a single robot, a historical timeline of important events that's occurred in reference to
  AI technologya and a bottom section that describes more in-depthly the creation process. 
  As for the people will be including, when users hover them a parapgraph of text should appear that states 
  fact-checked and peer-rewieved information reagrding how AI technology has impacted the labor force, both 
  positive and negative aspecst to it, and how/why it may not always be trustworthy. Then, when the robots 
  hovered over it angrily shakes and generates random falsified information instead. To do such, we added
  numerous different sections to our HTML, like a "People" section that provides each individual person with their own
  button id's and hover element, a dividing section that explains what AI is in general, and a bottom section for additional 
  links/info.</p>

  <button class="reveal-btn" onclick="toggleText('text2')">Phase 2: Drawing the Illstruations</button>
  <p id="text2" class="hidden">The main images that we utilized for AI Technology, of the people and the robot were hand-drawn using Abode Illustrator 
  and then converted into vector images. After they were converted, Sav linked them directly into our HTML and aligned 
  each image, fitting them into a flex container/flexbox.</p>
