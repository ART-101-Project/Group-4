          Artificial intelligence is technology that allows computers and
          machines to engage in human intelligence in order to accomplish
          problem solving. Emerging as a field of computer science, AI seeks to
          process data information while recognizing patterns and making
          predictions/decisions modeled after human judgment. Linked to machine
          and deep learning, artificial intelligence “learns” from existing
          information that is programmed within the system. This allows the
          machine to facilitate cognitive functions that are usually associated
          with human minds and subsequent thinking.

 <p>Narrow AI or Also Known As ANI
    
Narrow AI is any kind of artificial intelligence system and/or form of AI technology that's sole purpose is to complete a set of
very specific actions or basic commands. While ANI's are created with the goal in mind of serving and exceling in a cognitive 
capability, this particular sub-category of AI technologies still aren't able to independently learn new skills that it's not
already programmed and/or wasn't intially designed to learn. These kind of technologies are developed by combining a subfield of 
artifical intelligence called "machine learning" with neural network algorithms to fucntion properly and accomplish the specificed 
tasks it's programmed to complete. Through machine learning, AI systems are provided with the ability to process data and statistics, 
while simultaneously applying problem-solving strategies that are similar to that of strategies used by actual people, like that of 
trail and error, to improve it's own processes and "think" at faster rates. Examples of such A.I. include image recognition software,
self-driving cars, and AI virtual assistants.</p>



<p>Artifical Genral Intelligence (AGI)

The main images that we utilized for AI Technology, of the people and the robot were hand-drawn using Abode Illustrator 
and then converted into vector images. After they were converted, group member, Savvy Burch linked the inrcedible 
illustrations they had made directly into our main index.html and aligned each image, fitting them into a flex 
container/flexbox.</p>

<p>Artificial Superintelligence

For the third phase, we shifted our attention over to implmenting the main basic functions that we wanted our webpage to have 
through Javascript and created four different Javascript files. For the first file, group member, Manuel Marshutz, formatted and 
coded our index.js file for the team and layed out the basic framework for our website. Within, the file he added background nodes 
and event listeners so that every time one of the people were hovered over their illustration would be enlarged and the background 
behind them would slightly darken.He then added event listeners to box 1 and a separate Javascript for the popup content that's 
supposed to appear above the people, of our website, by applying callback functions. Next, Manuel also created our Javascript, 
nodes.js file, using the data structure to set parameters for various elements like that of width, height, size, and etc.. He then 
added event listeners and various functions for each node.</p>
